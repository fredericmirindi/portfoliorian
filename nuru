            The Immigrant Integration Through Environmental Awareness in Manitoba aims
            to raise awareness and integrate newcomers to the province on local environmental issues. It
            recognizes that immigrants are an important part of the Manitoban community and that their
            awareness in preserving the environment can significantly contribute to the protection
            of the region's natural resources.
